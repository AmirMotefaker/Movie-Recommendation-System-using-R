    "# What is Movie Recommendation?\n",
    "- A movie recommendation system, or a movie recommender system, is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users’ film preferences based on their past choices and behavior. It’s an advanced filtration mechanism that predicts the possible movie choices of the concerned user and their preferences towards a domain-specific item, aka movie.\n",

    "- The most popular categories of the ML algorithms used for movie recommendations include content-based filtering and collaborative filtering systems.\n",

    "            - User-based collaborative filtering. The idea is to look for similar patterns in movie preferences in the target user and other users in the database.\n",
    "            - Item-based collaborative filtering. The basic concept here is to look for similar items (movies) that target users rate or interact with.\n"
