    "# What is Movie Recommendation?\n",
    "- A movie recommendation system, or a movie recommender system, is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users’ film preferences based on their past choices and behavior. It’s an advanced filtration mechanism that predicts the possible movie choices of the concerned user and their preferences towards a domain-specific item, aka movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filtration Strategies for Movie Recommendation Systems\n",
    "- The most popular categories of the ML algorithms used for movie recommendations include content-based filtering and collaborative filtering systems.\n",
    "    - Content-Based Filtering\n",
    "    - Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "        - Collaborative filtering algorithms are divided into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - User-based collaborative filtering. The idea is to look for similar patterns in movie preferences in the target user and other users in the database.\n",
    "            - Item-based collaborative filtering. The basic concept here is to look for similar items (movies) that target users rate or interact with.\n",

    "# How to Build a Movie Recommendation System?\n",
    "- The basics of film recommendation engines are in machine learning, we could on to building an actual movie recommendation system.\n",
    "    1. Data. \n",
    "        - ML systems need data, so find and import the essential libraries with movie datasets that already have global ratings.\n",
    "    2. Analysis. \n",
    "        - Create generic recommendations of top-rated movies from the existing dataset.\n",
    "    3. Personalization. \n",
    "        - Get personalized ratings by providing your own movie scores.\n",
    "    4. Strategy. \n",
    "        - Implement a content-based or collaborative filtering strategy.\n",
    "    5. Combination. \n",
    "        - Combine recommendation lists to get a reasonable estimate across the ratings. The combined dataset of movie ratings can now be used for either filtering model.\n",
