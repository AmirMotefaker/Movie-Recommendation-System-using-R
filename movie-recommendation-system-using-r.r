These can be based on various criteria, including past purchases, search history, demographic information, and other factors. Recommender systems are highly useful as they help users discover products and services they might otherwise have not found on their own.\n","\n","- Recommender systems are trained to understand the preferences, previous decisions, and characteristics of people and products using data gathered about their interactions. These include impressions, clicks, likes, and purchases. Because of their capability to predict consumer interests and desires on a highly personalized level, recommender systems are a favorite with content and product providers. They can drive consumers to just about any product or service that interests them, from books to videos to health classes to clothing.\n","\n","# Types of Recommendation Systems:\n","- **Collaborative filtering** algorithms recommend items (this is the filtering part) based on preference information from many users (this is the collaborative part). \n","\n","- **Content filtering**, by contrast, uses the attributes or features of an item  (this is the content part) to recommend other items similar to the user’s preferences. \n","\n","- **Hybrid recommender systems** combine the advantages of the types above to create a more comprehensive recommending system.\n","\n","- **Context filtering** includes users’ contextual information in  the recommendation process.
